# Good Characters

A list of Good Characters for generating cool-looking garbage text.
Instead of generating a random character from U+0000 to U+2500, try grabbing
one from here!

Things that are probably true about `characters.txt` but are not guaranteed:

* Each line is no more than 16 codepoints long
* Each line is sorted by Unicode scalar value
* Few to no codepoints with scalar values above U+FFFF are included
* All the characters look super cool
